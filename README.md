# Overview

Hi! this is my Daily Planning Mobile App

It was done using React Native through Expo, also using the React Hook Form library for the forms

This app was done so people can organize all of the activities to be done throughout the day, it allows to create,
edit and delete notes that describe what you are going to do at a certain time of the day. It saves the data through
local storage
