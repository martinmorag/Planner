# Overview

Hi! This is my Planner developed in Expo React Native

It's a mobile app that allow people to record activites that they are planning to do throughout the week, they can keep track of what they need to do on every hour of every day of the week, they can also delete or edit the notes that they create

My purpose for creating this app was to help people be more organized, this was also aiming to help people remember the things that they needed to do so they don't miss a deadline.

# Development Environment

For this app I used Expo React Native

I used the firebase library for storage and authentication and the moment library to keep better and more clear track of time of days and week.

# Future Work

- In the future I may add a monthly overview of the activities
- Another thing that can be added are shared activites so people can invite other people to an activity
- One of the things I could add are a check for each of the activites, to let the user know which ones are already completed
